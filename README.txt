# Pygame
Pygame is a Python module designed for writing video games.

## Installation
Before you can make or play any pygame, you might have to download
the pygame module into your python program if you dont have already.
Since Spyder was used to make this game, then use the package 
manager from Anaconda Cloud (https://anaconda.org/prkrekel/pygame*)
to install pygame.
*this is the package I installed and it worked for me

## About
No formal name for this game yet. Right now, it's called 'Avoid the Asteriods'.
The objective of the game is move your little spaceship around to avoid getting
hit by the astroid floating around.

## Bugs
After adding my pictures of the asteroids and the spaceship, you can see
the outline of the picture even though its a png image.
